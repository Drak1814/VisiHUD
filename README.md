# oUF_Drak
This is a oUF Layout that does NOT replace the stock Blizzard player/target/focus/pet unit frames. It is intended to be used as a HUD that only appears while in combat.

Features include aura filtering, threat highlighting, display of all secondary resources, cast bars for player/pet/target, and combat feedback text. Mouse over the frames for more detailed health and power text. Some elements auto-adjust based on role (healer, tank, damage).

Required: oUF Core

Recomended: oUF MovableFrames, oUF SmoothUpdate, oUF SpellRange

Based on the most excellent work of Phanx!
